		description = A new home for a new you!  The AngleCan Arcology is a compact space for and your life partner's existance into eternity.  At least, that's what the advert says.  In reality you will be paying people to move in.  The payoff is that, by filling this with structure with colonists, you will be able to recruit new kerbonauts from this colony for free!  Simply send your exisiting kerbonaut in and pull out the civilan recruit.  Train them in a Mobile Processing Lab (not included).
