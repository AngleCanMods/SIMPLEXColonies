SIMPLEX Colonies extends the reach of Kerbals across the system and beyond

## Description

A lightweight mod that adds heavy weight arcologies and colonists into the game.

Colonists are a resource. They live private lives within closed arcology systems. Some maybe interested in becoming kerbonauts, but this requires Interest to be generated within the Arcology and a visiting kerbonaut to 'recruit' a colonist.

There are two arcologies. Both will allow kerbonaut recruitment, one will allow colonists to replicate themselves. This requires the arcology to be landed. This is not a space dwelling.

A taxi part will allow you to transport colonists to a colony.

Recommended: Extraplanetary Launchpads. The Arcologies are 350tons and 420tons. 45 metres wide. Good luck trying to launch this, or even land it! Build it onsite.
